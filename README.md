# Storyteller: The Lost Chapters: A Custom Storyteller Campaign
Are you craving more Storyteller levels?  Seeking a puzzling challenge?  Want to see the Isobel behead the Knight?  Fret no longer, I have created the Storyteller's first custom campaign!  This collection includes 10 chapters, totaling 68 original levels that push Storyteller's mechanics to their limit.  Try it for yourself!

This campaign uses 11DLittlewood's custom levels mod, which can be downloaded from the designated link below.  Additional special thanks goes to @NotSoDogNinja on Discord for lending their art to fill in some missing interactions.  If you like the campaign or are having any problems, you can leave a comment or get in touch with me over on the Storyteller Custom Levels Discord server.

# Installation Instructions
1. Download and load the Custom Level mod using the instructions on its GitHub page.
2. Download the latest release of Storyteller: The Lost Chapters
3. The zip file contains eight folders corresponding to each chapter.  Place all eight of these folders into the custom_levels folder.

# Important Notes
- Although the level editor works mechanics-wise, there are many missing art assets for characters who were never intended to be in certain scenes.  I tried to avoid these cases whenever possible, but some levels do have missing assets, such as blue squares for thought bubbles, no revive animation, no beheaded animation, issues when talking to the Professor, etc.  None of these should interfere with gameplay, but some interactions may just _look_ a little odd.
- Due to the nature of the mod, custom levels can only be accessed after beating the main campaign.  They will appear on the page after Epilogue.
- Please refrain from looking into a level's text file.  Though not always, it can occasionally give away part of a level's solution.
- If you find any bugs with goals (a goal isn't being fulfilled when it should be, a goal is being triggered without being fulfilled) or have any other general feedback, let me know through Steam comments or by contacting me @DanielDavidGuy on discord.
